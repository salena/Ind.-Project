# Ind.-Project
This project is designed to give young adults/ first time apartment renters/ intro to the workforce a way to budget their apartment rent and plan how much to spend on month to month rent based on a user salary.  
The updated project includes adding functionality to updating a user's budget and breaking up the budget into how much is accounted for retirement, taxes, misc, etc. This is innovative because it is a real-world concept, and everyone should be aware of this information.
